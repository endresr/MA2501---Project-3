The plots are made in main.py and saved manually in {images/..}, it is done manually because of laziness.
The project report is found in report.tex or MA2501__Project_3.pdf
A lot of long calculations are done in heavyCalc.py and result saved in heavyCalc.pkl which main.py imports to use in plots. Our last computation are thus saved in this folder, and can be used "straight out of the box". If you want to run your own calculation with other values, you should consider either changing the filename in heavyCalc.py first or backup the given results.
